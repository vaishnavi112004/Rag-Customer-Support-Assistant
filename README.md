# 🛠️ Customer Support RAG Assistant

An advanced **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to provide technical support for TechNova X1000 routers. This project uses **LangGraph** for sophisticated workflow orchestration and includes a **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)** escalation mechanism.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Agentic Workflow**: Uses LangGraph to classify user intent and grade document relevance before answering.
*   **Corrective RAG**: If retrieved documents are irrelevant, the system identifies the gap and escalates instead of hallucinating.
*   **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)**: Integrated hand-off panel for human agents to take over complex or sensitive queries.
*   **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation history using `MemorySaver` checkpointing.
*   **High Precision**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings for accurate technical retrieval.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a non-linear graph-based path:
1.  **Classify**: Is this a technical or account-related question?
2.  **Retrieve**: Fetch relevant chunks from the manual.
3.  **Grade**: Are these chunks actually useful?
4.  **Generate/Escalate**: Either provide a grounded answer or ask a human for help.
